## Rationale

Repl is a great window into a running program, but the textual nature of its 
output limits developer's ability to inspect the program: a text is not an 
object, and we are dealing with objects in the VM.

Reveal aims to solve this problem by creating an in-process repl output pane 
that makes inspecting values as easy as selecting an interesting datum. It 
recognizes the value of text as a universal interface, that's why its output 
looks like a text: you can select it, copy it, save it into a file. Unlike text,
reveal output holds references to printed values, making inspecting selected 
value a matter of opening a context menu.

Unlike datafy/nav based tools, Reveal does not enforce a particular data 
representation for any given object, making it an open set â€” that includes 
datafy/nav as one of the available options. It does not use datafy/nav by 
default because in the absence of inter-process communication to datafy is 
to lose.

Not being limited to text, Reveal uses judicious syntax highlighting to aid 
in differentiating various objects: text `java.lang.Integer` looks differently 
depending on whether it was produced from a symbol or a class.

## Reveal Pro

Reveal aims to be an extensible tool suitable for helping with development of 
any Clojure program. [Reveal Pro](https://vlaaad.github.io/reveal-pro) provides 
a set of extensions that improve developer experience by providing more tools, 
so you can focus on your problem with data and knowledge you need, available 
as soon as you need it.

## Versioning, stability, public and internal code

Reveal uses `1.MAJOR.REVISION` versioning where:
- `1` is a static prefix for compatibility with semantic versioning. Reveal
  should never introduce breaking changes, so if an update broke something, 
  please file a bug report;
- `MAJOR` is a number that is incremented when there are significant changes or 
  improvements to Reveal;
- `REVISION` is a commit number from the beginning of a history.

Reveal's compatibility promise applies to its public API: `vlaaad.reveal` ns, 
everything else is implementation detail that is subject to change. Reveal's UI 
and controls might change in the future.
